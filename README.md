## Workflow

Each person just needs to enter their solutions into the appropriate file
in their folder and then compile `main.tex`.

If you're having trouble using Git just email me your contributions
<steven.clontz@gmail.com>.

## Compiling

You may need to install extra packages... it JustWorked on mac (using
MacTeX) for me, but Ubuntu required:

    sudo apt-get install texlive-math-extra texlive-latex-extra

## Deadline

Let's have chapter 1 exercises ready to discuss by **September 30**. We
will schedule a google hangout at that time.
